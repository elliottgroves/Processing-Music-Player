# Processing-Music-Player
A project from 2010 done in Processing. A simple music player which plays local files and mp3s if you provide a url.

Download instructions to run natively in Processing:

1. If you don't already have Processing, download it for free at processing.org
2. Extract the .zip file, run the .pde within in Processing

Enjoy!

Press buttons 1-7 on your keyboard to change the color scheme. The only way to quit as of now is alt-f4.

To avoid any copyright issues, I used all songs I created.
