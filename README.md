# Processing-Music-Player
A project from 2010 done in Processing. A simple music player/visualizer which plays local files and mp3s if you provide a url, while changing colors of the interface based on the frequency bands of the song being played.

The source code can be found in the source folder -> ProcessingMusicPlayer.pde.

Simply download the .zip folder and run the application inside. Comes pre-loaded with songs.
Press buttons 1-7 on your keyboard to change the color scheme.
The only way to quit as of now is alt-f4.

This application is meant to be more of a fun demonstration than a functional application, just to be clear.

If you wish to edit this application, or add your own music:

1. Download Processing at processing.org and open the .pde file. Click yes to the prompt about a Sketch Folder.
2. Processing will automatically create a sketch folder. Open it by going to Sketch -> Show Sketch Folder.
3. Inside the Sketch Folder create a folder named "data".
4. Add your own songs as .mp3 files to this data folder.
5. Head to line 41 and replace the songs.add({songname}) commands with the names of your .mp3 files in the data folder.
6. Enjoy!

To avoid any copyright issues, I used all songs I created.
